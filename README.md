# Ant-Colony-Optimization

This repository contains an implementation of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm in C++. This project was developed as part of a university course on designing efficient algorithms, specifically for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

## Files Description

### AntColonyTraveller.cpp

  - Implements the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem.
  - Defines classes and functions for managing ants, updating pheromone trails, and finding the best solution.
  - Includes multithreading support for concurrent ant exploration.

### AdjacencyMatrix.cpp

  - Provides functionality for managing adjacency matrices.
  - Defines operations for displaying matrices, inserting values, and reading graph data from files.
  - Includes methods for file reading and graph initialization.

These files collectively constitute the core functionality of the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem.

## Project Report

### Projektowanie Efektywnych Algorytmow ACO.pdf

  - Contains a detailed description and implementation of the ant colony optimization algorithm for the traveling salesman problem in Polish.
